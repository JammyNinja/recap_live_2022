# Introduction + context
This whole repository is going to be about creating a README file and using markdown.
We will be adding some information about how to achieve each of the below ways of formatting a document.

1. Bold/italic text A
2. Bulletpoint lists A
3. Hyperlinks B
4. Images B

# Links
## Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks with a set of square brackets [], follwed by a set of parentheses ()

[something like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=github+mascot)

## Link to a document section
[somewhere in the document](#introduction--context)

## Images
Just like hyperlinks, but with an exalamation point(!) first:
