# Introduction + context
This whole repository is going to be about creating a README file and using markdown.
We will be adding some information about how to achieve each of the below ways of formatting a document.

1. Bold/italic text A
2. Bulletpoint lists A
3. Hyperlinks B
4. Images B

# Formatting
## Bold and italic
Plain text is just like this, just write the text

*one asterisk will make things italic
*like this*

_one underscore will also make it italic
_like this_

**two asterisks will make something bold
**like this**

__two underscores, too!
__like this__

What if we want both italic and bold?
**_like this_**
__*or this*__

## Bulletpoint lists
Bullets are done with a hyphen
- like this
- and this
- dont forget the space!
    - sub bullet with an indent
  - two spaces, or a tab

1. number lists are easy
2. number plus a full stop

# Links
## Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks with a set of square brackets [], follwed by a set of parentheses ()

[something like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=github+mascot)

## Link to a document section
[somewhere in the document](#introduction--context)

## Images
Just like hyperlinks, but with an exalamation point(!) first:
